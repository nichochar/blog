Last Friday was my last day at <a href="http://www.starmakerstudios.com">StarMaker</a>, and beginning next Tuesday, I am proud to be joining the team at <a href="http://URX.com">URX</a>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
After having stayed a while at StarMaker, and having learned a lot about B2C mobile apps,
I am excited to join a more engineering and science focused product.
If you don't already know about URX, I suggest you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApS4DlHG3k">check them out</a>;
they are revolutionizing the way users navigate the tree structure that is mobile apps.
<br>
I am thrilled to join a team working on such an innovative product that - I believe - will change the smartphone ecosystem as a whole.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The challenges ahead seem terribly exciting. This this time I won't just be fooling around in Python, but also in Go, Scala, and many other cool technologies. I've been looking for a good excuse to mess with these for too long, so this is fantastic news!
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you StarMaker and all the people there, especially some engineers - who will recognize themselves - for all the things I learned, all the things I broke, and all the ones I fixed.
</p>
<p>
<br>
On to the next adventure!
