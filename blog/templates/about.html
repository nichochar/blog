<h1>About</h1>
<img id="my-picture" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/me(light).png') }}" />
<p>I'm, I'm <b>Nicholas</b>. I'm from Paris, but raised in english my whole life. Now I live in San Francisco.
I do a lot of different things.  
</br></br>
I'm a developer, trained as a french engineer in math and physics (that means lots and lots of theory, without computers), with a hint of CS. Nowadays I write mostly <b>python</b>.
</br></br>
Amongst too many things I'm curious about, I'm passionate about technology, entrepreneurship, math, innovation, and <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/welcome-to-the-internet.jpg') }}">the internet</a>.

<h2>Engineering</h2>
<p>
I went to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Paris/What-is-MINES-ParisTech-formerly-%C3%89cole-des-Mines-de-Paris">Mines ParisTech</a>, for a degree in general engineering. I specialized in entrepreneurship and computer science.</br></br>
I've always been in love with math and computers, so ending up where in server stuff and data science was pretty logical.
If you want to see my work, check out my <a href="/projects">projects section</a>. </br></br>

Most of my code is also on <a href="https://github.com/nichochar"> github</a>.</br></br>
If you are interested in working with me, you can check out <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='pdf/CV.pdf') }}">resume</a>, 
and I usually answer my <a href="mailto:nicholascharriere+blog@gmail.com"> email</a>.

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
Music is kind of a big deal, probably not teaching you anything here.
I played classical piano for 12 years, but now I am mainly on the
passive listener side. I mainly listen to classical, jazz, deep house, minimal, hip hop.

<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
I like to call myself an amateur photographer, but mostly I take pictures of things that don't move, since capturing people is still much too hard for me!
</br></br>
I shoot with very little regularity, but you can find some of my stuff on <a href="http://500px.com/nichochar/">500px</a>

<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>
A few years ago, I discovered chess, and I haven't managed to stop playing since. I'm far from being a grand master, but if you want to
play I'm always down, just send me a request on <a href="http://www.chess.com/members/view/nichochar">my chess.com</a> account.
</p>

</br>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>
I play basketball, tennis, and I run a little. Nothing serious, but I like the endorphines.
