        <i>A pixel art NFT collection</i>
    <br>
    In order to form a first hand opinion of web3 and crypto, I decided to deploy a project to the ethereum blockchain and learn a little solidity. <a href="https://blockchainsmokers.xyz">blockchainsmokers</a> became a fully blown out art project of smoking procedurally generated pixels.

        <i>Write for 5 minutes, every day!</i>
    <br>
    My girlfriend loves to write, but finds it hard to make it a daily habit. I worked on this daily prompt creative writing app: <a href="http://avostories.com">avostories</a>.

    <h2><a href="https://nicholascharriere.com/">This Website</a></h2>
    <p>
        The code for this website is also <a href="https://github.com/nichochar/blog">open source on github</a>.<br>
        It is a python Flask application, ran in on a Digital Ocean box (which I love), served with Nginx and uWSGI.

    <h2><a href="https://bytesizetheories.com">bytesizetheories.com</a></h2>
    <p>
        Another blog, focused on small bites of knowledge in software (more or less relevant).
        This was built with Hugo and deployed with nginx.

    <h2><a href="https://nicholascharriere.com/treestumps">Nicholas, on stumps, with a mustache</a></h2>
    <p>
      Emily and I went to Anrold, and the tree stumps led to an inspiring art project.

    <h2><a href="http://loveaas.com">Love as a service</a></h2>
    <p>
        Love as a service (loveaas) provides a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common problem of spreading the love.
        It was written as a response to the fuck off as a service project.<br>
        <a href="http://loveaas.com/everyone/Nick">Quick example?</a>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/nichochar/clhn">Hacker New CLIs</a></h2>
    <p>
        When learning a new language, my goto app is not a todo list, but rather a command line hacker news client.
        Here are a couple I have on github, in <a href="https://github.com/nichochar/clhn">elixir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nichochar/clhn-go">go</a>.
